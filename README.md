# Face Detection Model

## Overview
This project involves developing a robust face detection model utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and tools. The process begins with setting up the environment and installing necessary dependencies like TensorFlow, OpenCV, and matplotlib. Following this, we collect images using the OpenCV library to create a comprehensive dataset.
