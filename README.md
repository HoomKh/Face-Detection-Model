# Face Detection Model
 
This project involves developing a robust face detection model utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and tools. The process begins with setting up the environment and installing necessary dependencies like TensorFlow, OpenCV, and matplotlib. Following this, we collect images using the OpenCV library to create a comprehensive dataset. The collected data undergoes pre-processing, which includes image augmentation to enhance model training. Using TensorFlow, we then build and train the face detection model, fine-tuning it for accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the model is evaluated and optimized to ensure it performs well in real-world scenarios.
